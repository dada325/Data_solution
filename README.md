# Data Solution Code
Find question to practise with.
Find practical solutions to your coding problems in data science.


## About this Page




### What will I build in this page?





## Description
When I first confront a problem of data science, I want to try to solve it with the knowledge from the book. But most of time it fails, the problem may be too complex and not easy to abstract to a computer problem. 

We understand the challenges and complexities that data scientists face while working on various projects. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive platform where data science enthusiasts and professionals can find practical solutions to their coding problems.

We want to cover a wide range of topics, including data preprocessing, data visualization, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, deep learning, natural language processing, Reinforcement learning and more. We believe in hands-on learning, so you'll find plenty of interactive coding exercises and projects that allow you to apply your newfound knowledge. Now the Contents is still Work in progress.

## Status:
 now WIP is the section of Reinforcement learning, so please feel free to fork of other section. 

# Machine Learning 

## Natural Language Processing (NLP)

## Computer Vision

## Recommender Systems

## Time Series Forecasting

## Transfer Learning

## Adversarial Machine Learning

## AutoML (Automated Machine Learning)

## Reinforcement Learning.


 0. The Basic

For a detailed overview of each library, please refer to the [original article](https://neptune.ai/blog/the-best-tools-for-reinforcement-learning-in-python).

Conclusion
The choice of library depends on your specific needs and requirements. Some libraries like RL_Coach and RLlib offer a wide range of algorithms and are regularly updated. Others like KerasRL and Pyqlearning have limited features but are easy to understand and use. TFAgents and Stable Baselines are promising libraries with a great set of algorithms and active development. Dopamine and SpinningUp are designed for fast prototyping and are highly customizable.
