# Data Solution Code
Find question to practise with.
Find practical solutions to your coding problems in data science.


## About this Page




### What will I build in this page?





## Description
When I first confront a problem of data science, I want to try to solve it with the knowledge from the book. But most of time it fails, the problem may be too complex and not easy to abstract to a computer problem. 

We understand the challenges and complexities that data scientists face while working on various projects. Our mission is to provide a comprehensive platform where data science enthusiasts and professionals can find practical solutions to their coding problems.

We want to cover a wide range of topics, including data preprocessing, data visualization, machine learning algorithms, statistical analysis, deep learning, natural language processing, Reinforcement learning and more. We believe in hands-on learning, so you'll find plenty of interactive coding exercises and projects that allow you to apply your newfound knowledge. Now the Contents is still Work in progress.

## Status:
 now WIP is the section of Reinforcement learning, so please feel free to fork of other section.
